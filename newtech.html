                <p class="card-text">In the class of digital media I leared a lot about video games and its impact on society.
                    I learned about the good, like how video games are used to relive stress and make friends, and the
                    bad, like discrimination. Overall I belive that video games are great because it can bring all sorts of people together no matter their circumstances.

                <p class="card-text">The presentation on Deepfakes was something that actually kinda spooked me. 
                    It was surprisingly accurate how realistic those faces looked and how people could be mistaken and falsely accused for things they didnt do.
                    I beleve that this technology can be a real problem when after a while no one can tell the difference between reality and technology.

                <p class="card-text">
                    I belive that VR and AR is a step in the right direction for technology. VR and AR can give us a new perspective on many things, like video games, technology and even job training.
                    VR can be used to create unique experiences that can't be created anywhere else like driving tests, surgery operations, and much more.
                    AR can also be used to help create a new perspective on the world, like decorating a room with furniture and even seeing your friends in the room with you.
                    I belive that VR and AR are a step in the right direction for the furture.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Animation in this class is something I had a lot of fun with. 
                    Drawing myself was a lot of fun and I'm not much of an artist but I am really proud of how it came out.
                    Animation really isn't my thing so persuing this track isn't something i'm going to do.
                    I belive that animation can create unique perspectives on many things in life, so animation is beneficial to us.
